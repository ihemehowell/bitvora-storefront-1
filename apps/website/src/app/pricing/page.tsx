  {
    q: "Is there a free plan?",
    a: "No. Every plan is paid, so there's no free tier to outgrow. The limits of each plan are listed above.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I reach a limit?",
    a: "You'll be asked to upgrade before you can add more stores or products. Everything you've already published stays live.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change plans later?",
    a: "Yes, you can upgrade at any time. To move to a smaller plan, your stores and products need to fit within that plan's limits.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does annual billing work?",
    a: "Annual billing charges you once for 10 months and covers 12 — that's two months free compared with paying monthly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods can my customers use?",
    a: "Bank transfer and pay-on-delivery are supported today, with card payments coming soon.",
